This repository contains a .vimrc more or less updated

It is here just for my convenience but if it gets useful for you, please
feel free to use it at your own risk/discretion.

WARNING: I'm using vundle and you might want to install it first and create a
dummy .vimrc before replacing it with, or modifying it inspired by, this one.

Suggestions will be appreciated of course!
